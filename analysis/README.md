### JHU Biobank Analysis

This folder contains examples of basic analysis required to generate the data for the JHU Biobank Data Repository as well as supplemental analyses that were carried out


#### Raw Data Processing

This folder contains raw data processing scripts:
* RNA-Seq: The raw data for the processing of the raw reads can be found in the [raw_data_process](./raw_data_process/) folder. This contains the Python scripts required to compute the data from the raw `fastq` files to the `sf` formatted counts files. All data can be found in the synapse folder [syn19522967](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn19522967). Transcript quantities can also be found in a [Synapse table]()
* Exome-Seq: The exomeSeq data was harmonized using a [scientific workflow](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/rare-disease-workflows/tree/master/gene-variant-workflow) available in a different repository with the results in a [Synapse table]().


### Figures for manuscript
